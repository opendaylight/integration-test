      "message": "I talked with our infra folks and the story I\u0027m told is this. You can use *any* extra\nip\u0027s you want and put them on a subinterface. BUT, apparently the only traffic that is\nallowed to/from the host VM is to/from the ONE ip address it\u0027s assigned on eth0.\n\nMeaning if you wanted the ip you give to eth0:1 to be reachable from outside\nthe system, it would be blocked by the infra security group rules.\n\nYou can try it though, as there is another suite doing something *maybe* similar\nand their CSIT is passing. They are actually bringing up an extra tools vm, grabbing\nit\u0027s ip address to use for a VIP and then shutting down that extra VM and using\nthat IP. According to the infra folks that IP should not be reachable from outside\nthat specific VM (which is now shutdown). I did not look too close at their\nCSIT (link below), but either they don\u0027t need it to be reachable or the infra\nsecurity groups aren\u0027t as tight as we think.\n\nFinally, I would suggest to use something like the 172 or 192.168 nets as those \nare typically for private/test kind of networks anyway. You can test all of this\nin the sandbox to learn more.\n\nhope it helps\n\nlink to the sxp suite doing the VIP stuff:\nhttps://logs.opendaylight.org/releng/jenkins092/sxp-csit-3node-periodic-routing-only-carbon/14/archives/log.html.gz",

      "message": "Hi Jamo,\n\nI have changed the sub-interface ip to the private network 192.168 and checked on the sandbox. It is working fine.\n\nAbout the approach that you suggested, I believe that it is not feasible for us as we do not have any Tool System VM in our csit job. The sxp-csit-3node job have a tool system VM initially which they are just shutting down using their robot suite test case. They are not creating this VM in their test cases.",
