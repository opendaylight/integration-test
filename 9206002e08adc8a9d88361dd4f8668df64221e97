      "message": "Yes, that\u0027s right. After this change this becomes incompatible with Beryllium (that\u0027s also why it is not included as one of the execution releases in jenkins_job_builder), so maybe what we should do is leave a single folder for boron/carbon and following releases (it will also simplify the testing code, as there wonÂ´t be need to check the release)",
