      "message": "OpenStack CLI Get List\u0027s input $cmd must output json format, otherwise it will result in exception in RequestsLibrary.To Json    ${json}, for such case, we need to trace why. robotframework doesn\u0027t provide strong enough exception catch way, so we don\u0027t have a good way to catch exception from RequestsLibrary.To Json    ${json}. For my local test,OpenStack Suite Setup failed, DevstackUtils.Devstack Suite Setup failed, but I can\u0027t find any valuable debug info for this, finally I positioned here, because \"openstack hypervisor list -f json\" doesn\u0027t have any output except stderr output (openstack can\u0027t work in cperf conainer without exporting those openstack environment variables), this is the reason I want to submit this fix, you can\u0027t assume everything works normally, everything works in opendaylight.org, we need to run csit test suites in our environment.",
