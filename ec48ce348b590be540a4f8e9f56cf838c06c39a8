      "message": "I am not sure this still works. There was an e-mail I sent, explaining why ${HEADERS_YANG_JSON} is sometimes needed in recent version of RequestsLibrary.\n\nTo be more specific. If recent Put_Requests sees \"application/json\", it automatically assumes data is Python object. As we pass ${body} as a string with Json representation instead, Put_Request would add quotes, which would make the data invalid. Using \"application/yang.data+json\" as content type does not trigger that automatic conversion.",

On the ther hand if this something that is going to happen we will need to create a bulk change for our suites. We can open a Trello card for this.",
