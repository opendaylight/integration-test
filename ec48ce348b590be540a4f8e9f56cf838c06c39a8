If recent Put_Requests sees \"application/json\", it automatically assumes data is Python object. As we pass ${body} as a string with Json representation instead, Put_Request would add quotes, which would make the data invalid. Using \"application/yang.data+json\" as content type does not trigger that automatic conversion.",
