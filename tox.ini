# # - Select E121, E123, E126, E226, E241, E242 and E704 which are turned OFF
# #   by default but represent guidelines accepted by us.
# # - Do not select E133 because it is incompatible with E123 which was
# #   selected instead.
# - It turns out that now all checks except E133 are enabled so the select
#   can be simplified to be just "E,W". However a new version could change
#   that (select E133 instead of E123) but that should be caught by the
#   verify job.
