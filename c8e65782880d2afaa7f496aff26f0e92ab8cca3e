      "message": "I was wondering about this one too.  Doesn\u0027t this line\nmean that \"IF Lithium\" then do the check, but do not report\na failure.  So that wont ever report anything but a pass.\nand \"IF !Lithium\" then it wont do any check.\n\nI think this patch is almost ready to be merged, btw.  I \nwould like to see more checks made throughout, but that\u0027s\nsomething we can add in a new patch.",
