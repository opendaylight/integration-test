      "message": "while debugging ARP learning suite failures in CSIT report (6/2) [1] https://logs.opendaylight.org/releng/jenkins092/netvirt-csit-1node-openstack-newton-nodl-v2-upstream-transparent-carbon/533/log.html.gz, I see there is no packet hit on table 17 flow entry which causes some VMs doesn\u0027t IP address. \nBut these flow dumps are collected in TC00 Verify Setup whereas VMs/Neutron Ports are created in Test Setup. There is a gap of ~3min. So we need to see the flows/groups immediately after creating VMs to see OF pipeline is proper.\nSo can add script to collect flow/group and ODL model dumps immediately after Test Setup ?",
