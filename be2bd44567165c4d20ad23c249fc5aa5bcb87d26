      "message": "Thank you for the advice.I encounted a problem when I try to fix it.I put the URI and data templates files into a folder, used the keyword Post_As_Json_Templated you advised, but an error reported by robot\ncause could not find variable ${ODL_STREAM}. I looked into the TemplateRequests.robot file find it does not be declared in Variables area\nand wonder how it jumped out at keyword Resolve_Text_From_Template_File with no assignment.\nSo I fixed it with another methord. Please check it in \nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/54346/.\nPlease check TC1_Query Single Topology for example.Thank you.",
