      "message": "I think the timers in general can be very much optimized:\n\n- 10 secs between retry seems like a long time\n- 30 secs timout seems also too long\n\nCan you please run this test in sandbox so we can estimate a good value for these timers?",

      "message": "Some test cases in this suite look very long and contain many verifications in them. Normally every test case should do one verification on some retrieved data like a REST response, this way you can easily spot an issue by looking at the test case that failed. Can you please split the test cases of this suite in more test cases containing less verification?",
