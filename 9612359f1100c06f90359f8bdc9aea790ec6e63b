      "message": "one general observation I see is that almost every check involves some extended polling (60s). That ends up adding\nsome noise to the code which makes it harder to read. If\npossible, remove those WUKS if there is no need for them.\n\nOne idea is to see if you can find one main check to make\nto know the environment should be in a proper state (e.g.,\nthat something on the dataplane (routes, etc)) exists which\nmeans that our controller has processed things. Then make\nyour other specific checks (which are great, btw) without\nthe WUKs.",
