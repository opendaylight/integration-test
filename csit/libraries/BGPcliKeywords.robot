*** Keywords ***
Start_Console_Tool
    [Arguments]    ${command}    ${tool_opt}
    [Documentation]    Start the tool ${command} ${tool_opt}
    BuiltIn.Log    ${command}
    ${output}=    SSHLibrary.Write    ${command} ${tool_opt}
    BuiltIn.Log    ${output}

Wait_Until_Console_Tool_Finish
    [Arguments]    ${timeout}
    [Documentation]    Wait ${timeout} for the tool exit.
    BuiltIn.Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    ${timeout}    1s    SSHLibrary.Read Until Prompt

Stop_Console_Tool
    [Documentation]    Stop the tool if still running.
    Utils.Write_Bare_Ctrl_C
    ${output}=    SSHLibrary.Read    delay=1s
    BuiltIn.Log    ${output}

Read_And_Fail_If_Prompt_Is_Seen
    [Documentation]    Try to read SSH to see prompt, but expect to see no prompt within SSHLibrary's timeout.
    ${passed}=    BuiltIn.Run_Keyword_And_Return_Status    BuiltIn.Run_Keyword_And_Expect_Error    No match found for '${ODL_SYSTEM_PROMPT}' in *.    Read_Text_Before_Prompt
    BuiltIn.Return_From_Keyword_If    ${passed}
    BGPSpeaker.Dump_BGP_Speaker_Logs
    Builtin.Fail    The prompt was seen but it was not expected yet

Read_Text_Before_Prompt
    [Documentation]    Log text gathered by SSHLibrary.Read_Until_Prompt.
    ...    This needs to be a separate keyword just because how Read_And_Fail_If_Prompt_Is_Seen is implemented.
    ${text}=    SSHLibrary.Read_Until_Prompt
    BuiltIn.Log    ${text}

Store_File_To_Workspace
    [Arguments]    ${source_file_name}    ${target_file_name}
    [Documentation]    Store the ${source_file_name} to the workspace as ${target_file_name}.
    ${output_log}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    cat ${source_file_name}
    BuiltIn.Log    ${output_log}
    Create File    ${target_file_name}    ${output_log}

Check_File_For_Word_Count
    [Arguments]    ${file_name}    ${word}    ${expected_count}
    [Documentation]    Count ${word} in ${file_name}. Expect ${expected_count} occurence(s)
    ${output_log}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    grep -o '${word}' ${file_name} | wc -l
    BuiltIn.Log    ${output_log}
    BuiltIn.Should_Be_Equal_As_Strings    ${output_log}    ${expected_count}

Count_Key_Value_Pairs

    [Documentation]    Check file for ${keyword} or ${keyword} ${value} pair and returns number of occurences
    ${output_log}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    grep '${keyword}' ${file_name} | grep -c ${value}
    ${count}=    Convert To Integer    ${output_log}
    [Return]    ${count}

Check_File_For_Occurence
    [Arguments]    ${file_name}    ${keyword}    ${value}=''
    [Documentation]    Check file for ${keyword} or ${keyword} ${value} pair and returns number of occurences
