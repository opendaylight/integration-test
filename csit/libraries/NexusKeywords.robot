    [Documentation]    Determine the exact Nexus directory to be used as a source for a particular test tool
    ...    Figure out what version of the tool needs to be pulled out of the

    ...    "<repository_url>/some/dir/somewhere/<tool-name>/<tool-name>-<version-tag>-${suffix}.jar"
    ...    where "<tool-name>" is the name of the tool and "<version-tag>" is
    ...    the version tag that is digged out of the maven metadata. This

    [Documentation]    Return string suitable for launching Java programs over SSHLibrary, depending on JRE version needed.
    ...    This requires that the SSH connection on which the command is going to be used is active as it is needed for querying files.
    ...    Commands composed for one SSH connection shall not be reused on other SSH connections as the two connections may have different Java setups.
