    # while feature request in bug 7892 is not done, we will quickly timeout and not retry the model dump get
    # request. This is because when it's done in a failed cluster state, it could take 20s for the reesponse to
    # to come back as the internal clustering times out waiting for a leader which will not come. When bug 7892
    # is resolved, we can remove the timeout=1 and max_retries=0, but likely have to modify the request itself to
    # pass a timeout to restconf
