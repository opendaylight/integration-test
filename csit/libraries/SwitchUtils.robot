Get Switch Datapath ID
    [Arguments]    ${switch}
    [Documentation]    Using the connection index for the given switch, will execute the command string

    ...    friendly (decimal) version of the datapath id in to switch.datapath_id and the value is also
    ...    returned from this keyword.
