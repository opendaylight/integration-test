Restore Current SSH Connection From Index
    [Arguments]    ${connection_index}
    [Documentation]    Restore active SSH connection in SSHLibrary to given index.
    ...
    ...    Restore the currently active connection state in
    ...    SSHLibrary to match the state returned by "Switch
    ...    Connection" or "Get Connection". More specifically makes
    ...    sure that there will be no active connection when the
    ...    \${connection_index} reported by these means is None.
    ...
    ...    There is a misfeature in SSHLibrary: Invoking "SSHLibrary.Switch_Connection"
    ...    and passing None as the "index_or_alias" argument to it has exactly the
    ...    same effect as invoking "Close Connection".
    ...    https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary/blob/master/src/SSHLibrary/library.py#L560
    ...
    ...    We want to have Keyword which will "switch out" to previous
    ...    "no connection active" state without killing the background one.
    ...
    ...    As some suites may hypothetically rely on non-writability of active connection,
    ...    workaround is applied by opening and closing temporary connection.
    ...    Unfortunately this will fail if run on Jython and there is no SSH server
    ...    running on localhost, port 22 but there is nothing easy that can be done about it.
    BuiltIn.Run Keyword And Return If    ${connection_index} is not None    SSHLibrary.Switch Connection    ${connection_index}
    # The background connection is still current, bury it.
    SSHLibrary.Open Connection    127.0.0.1
