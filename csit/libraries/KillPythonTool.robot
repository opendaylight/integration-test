...               This library assumes that a SSH connections exists (and is switched to)
...               to a Linux machine (usualy MININET) where the Python process should be killed.
...               TODO: The Utils.robot library has a "Run Command On Remote System" if we didn't want to make the assumption that an SSH connection was already open.
...               alternative TODO: Explain that it is not worth to perform separate SSH logins.
...
...               The argument ${filter} should hold what you would type to grep command in bash:
...               enclosed in single quotes, dots escaped by backslash and so on.
...               Note that single quote inside cannot be escaped, but may be typed as this: '"'"'

*** Keywords ***
Search_And_Kill_Remote_Python
    [Arguments]    ${filter}
    [Documentation]    The main keyword. Search for processes, Log the list of them, kill them.
    ${processes}=    Search_For_Remote_Python_Processes    ${filter}
    BuiltIn.Log    ${processes}
    Kill_Remote_Processes    ${processes}

Search_For_Remote_Python_Processes
    [Arguments]    ${filter}
    [Documentation]    Only searches for the list of processes, in case something else than kill has to be done with them.
    ${processes}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    ps -elf | egrep python | egrep ${filter} | egrep -v grep
    # TODO: Is "python" worth such a special treatment to have it mentioned in keyword name?
    [Return]    ${processes}

Kill_Remote_Processes
    [Arguments]    ${pself_lines}    ${signal}=9
    [Documentation]    Kill processes by PIDs from given list (no-op if the list is empty), using specified signal. Log the kill commands used.
    ${arg_length}=    BuiltIn.Get_Length    ${pself_lines}
    Return_From_Keyword_If    ${arg_length} == 0    # nothing to kill here
    ${commands}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    echo '${pself_lines}' | awk '{print "kill -${signal}",$4}'
    BuiltIn.Log    ${commands}
    ${stdout}    ${stderr}=    SSHLibrary.Execute_Command    echo 'set -exu; ${commands}' | sudo sh    return_stderr=True
    # TODO: Is -exu needed? Should we Log ${std*}?
