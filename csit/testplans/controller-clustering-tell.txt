# Place the suites in run order:

# disabling all "prefix based" suites. This functionality was newly
# introduced with these tests in 2017. The assumption is that
# development stopped in that area, but may continue at a later
# time. Still, the tests are failing and no resources to solve the
# failures at this time. If/When this changes, we can uncomment
# those suites. Note that every suite is commented out with it's
# accompanying "restart_with_tell_based_true" setup suite.
