*** Keywords ***
Delete Configurations
    [Documentation]    Delete all elements that were created in the test case section. These are done
    ...    in a local keyword so this can be called as part of the Suite Teardown. When called as part
    ...    of the Suite Teardown, all steps will be attempted. This prevents robot framework from bailing
    ...    on the rest of a test case if one step intermittently has trouble and fails. The goal is to attempt
    ...    to leave the test environment as clean as possible upon completion of this suite.
