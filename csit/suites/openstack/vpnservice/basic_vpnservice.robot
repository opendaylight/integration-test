*** Test Cases ***
Verify Tunnel Creation
    [Documentation]    Checks that vxlan tunnels have been created properly.
    [Tags]    exclude
    Log    This test case is currently a noop, but work can be added here to validate if needed.    However, as the    suite Documentation notes, it's already assumed that the environment has been configured properly.    If    we do add work in this test case, we need to remove the "exclude" tag for it to run.    In fact, if this
    ...    test case is critical to run, and if it fails we would be dead in the water for the rest of the suite,    we should move it to Suite Setup so that nothing else will run and waste time in a broken environment.
