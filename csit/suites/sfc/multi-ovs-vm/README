This repository provides:

- A virtual environment with docker installed
- A openvswitch docker container image (by default 2.5.9 yi yang patch)
- A companion utility, 'dovs', to run multiple containers with different setups


Startup and connect to the virtual environment:

> vagrant up
> vagrant ssh

Run a standalone openvswitch instance:

> docker run -itd --cap-add NET_ADMIN [--name NAME] docker-ovs:yyang


Use dovs to run complex configurations. For example:

- Spawn two independant openvswitch instances, with two namespaces attached to
  each instance, and use a running ODL to setup 2 overlay networks

  > dovs spawn --nodes 2 --guests 2 --nets 2 --odl 192.168.56.1 

See dovs/README for more info on dovs
