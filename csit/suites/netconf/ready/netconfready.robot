...
...               Try to detect whether Netconf is up and running and wait for
...               it for a configurable time if it is not yet up and running.
...
...               By default this is done by querying netconf-connector and
...               seeing whether it works. Some testsuites expect netconf-connector
...               to be ready as soon as possible and will fail if it is not. We
...               want to see a failure if this is the cause of the failure.
...
...               If the netconf-connector is not ready upon startup (as seen by
...               the first test case failing), the second case starts to repeat
...               the query for a minute to see whether it is going "to fix itself"
...               within the minute. If yes, then the testcase will pass, which
...               indicates that the "ODL cooldown" of 1 minute is not long enough
...               to allow for netconf-connector to initialize properly.
...
...               If the USE_NETCONF_CONNECTOR is forced to be False by the Robot
...               invocation argument, then the suite does not use netconf
...               connector for the readiness detection but merely waits for the
...               Netconf topology to appear. This is a weaker condition when
...               Netconf connector is about to be used but is necessary if the
...               suite in question does not use the Netconf connector.
...
...               If the first test case passed, then the second test case does
...               nothing.
...
...               The third test case then checks whether Netconf can pretty print
...               data. This sometimes makes problems, most likely due to too
...               new Robot Requests library with an interface incompatible with
...               this test suite.

Check_For_Bug_5014
    [Documentation]    If Netconf appears to be down, it may be due to bug 5014. Check if it is so and fail if yes.
    ...    Bug 5014 is about Netconf playing dead on boot until a device
    ...    configuration request is sent to it. To uncover this attempt to
    ...    configure and then deconfigure a device and then check if Netconf
    ...    is now up and running. If that turns out to be true, fail the case
    ...    as this signifies the bug 5014 to be present. Skip this testcase
    ...    if Netconf is detected to be up and running.
