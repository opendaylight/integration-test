...               Query netconf-connector and see if it works. Some testsuites
...               expect netconf-connector to be ready as soon as possible and
...               will fail if it is not. We want to see a failure if this is
...               the cause of the failure.
...
...               If the netconf-connector is not ready upon startup (as seen by
...               the first test case failing), the second case starts to repeat
...               the query for a minute to see whether it is going "to fix itself"
...               within the minute. If yes, then the testcase will pass, which
...               indicates that the "ODL cooldown" of 1 minute is not long enough
...               to allow for netconf-connector to initialize properly.
...
...               If the first test case passed, then the second test case does
...               nothing.
