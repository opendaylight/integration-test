...               Perform given count of update operations on ODL MDSAL. In first half the
...               requests are directed directly to MDSAL via Restconf and in the second
...               half the MDSAL is mounted onto a netconf connector and the reqursts are
...               directed to that connector. In both cases the netconf-testtool-restperfclient
...               tool is used to generate and send the requests and the requests are sent
...               synchronously as the netconf connector mounted MDSAL does not support
...               asynchronous requests. The restperfclient is used to generate the "update"
...               requests, the "create" request is issued in a sepate test case.
