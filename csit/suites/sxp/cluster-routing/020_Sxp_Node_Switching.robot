Documentation     Test suite to test cluster connection and propagation switchover using virtual IP, this suite requires additional TOOLS_SYSTEM_2 VM.
...               VM is used for its assigned ip-address that will be overlayed by virtual-ip used in test suites.
...               Resources of this VM are not required. At suite start this node is shutted down to reduce routing conflicts.
