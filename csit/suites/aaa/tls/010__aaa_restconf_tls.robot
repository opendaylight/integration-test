*** Test Cases ***
Basic Unsecure Restconf Request
    [Documentation]    Tests a basic HTTP request, just to ensure that system is working fine with normal, unsecure reqs
    Create Session    session    http://${ODL_SYSTEM_IP}:${RESTCONFPORT}    auth=${AUTH}    headers=${HEADERS}
    ${resp}    RequestsLibrary.Get Request    session    ${RESTCONF_MONITORING_URI}
    Should Contain    ${ALLOWED_STATUS_CODES}    ${resp.status_code}
    Delete All Sessions

TLS on Restconf without Server Cert
    [Documentation]    Tests an HTTPS request towards secure port with ODL secure config deactivated
    PycURLLibrary.Set Url    ${RESTCONF_MONITORING_URL}
    PycURLLibrary.Add Header    "Content-Type:application/json"
