Each TC testing common or specific resouce attribute should follow these steps.
Such TCs can be split into multiple TCs if needed.

Resource attributes:
Test CRUD operations with resource with the attribute set. Result codes are verified
for positive and negative TCs and error message is checked for negative TCs. Retrieve operation is
performed after each TC in order to verify whether the negative or positive TC resulted with
created resouce or non-created resource respectively.


Attribute elements:
Apply the same approach as in case of resource attributes also to attribute elements.


TCs for resource attributes and attribute elements:

    ...     C/R positive: Create with valid value
    ...     C/R negative: Create with invalid value
    ...     C/R negative: Create with multiple attributes/elements
    ...     C/R negative: Create with attribute set to null

    ...     U(add)/R positive: Update with valid value
    ...     U(add)/R negative: Update with invalid value
    ...     U(add)/R negative: Update with multiple valid values
    ...     U(add)/R negative: Update with one valid and one invalid value

    ...     U(modify)/R positive: Update with valid value
    ...     U(modify)/R negative: Update with invalid value
    ...     U(modify)/R negative: Update with multiple valid values
    ...     U(modify)/R negative: Update with one valid and one invalid value

    ...     U(delete)/R positive: Update with setting value to null i.e. delete attribute
    ...     U(delete)/R negative: Update non-existing attribute to null
    ...     U(delete)/R negative: Update with two attributes set to null
    ...     U(delete)/R negative: Update with one attribute set to null and one to valid value

    ...     D/R positive: Delete resouce with attribute set


TCs specific to resource attributes only:
    ...     TODO: We need to test also operations targetted to the attribute

TCs testing non-existing attributes and elements:
    ...     C/R negative: Create with non-existing attribute/element
    ...     U(add)/R negative: Update with non-existing attribute/element
    ...     U(delete)/R negative: Update with non-existing attribute/element


Test suites testing resource attributes and their elements should be structured according to this
template:
    1. Mandatory common/specific attributes only
        -> C/R (positive)
        -> D/R (positive)

    2. TCs for single common attribute
        note: some attributes can't be C/U at all
        a. valid resource operations
            -> C/R
            -> U(add)/R
            -> U(modify)/R
            -> U(delete)/R
            -> D/R
        b. valid resource attribute operations
            TODO: need to check if supported

        c. invalid resource cases:
            -> all operations with resources which are NP (not permitted)
            -> C/R - invalid value
            -> C/R - multiple ocurrences
            -> U(add)/R - invalid value
            -> U(add)/R - multiple occurrences
            -> U(modify)/R - invalid value
            -> U(modify)/R - multiple occurrences
            -> U(delete)/R - multiple occurrences

        d. invalid resource attribute operations
            TODO: need to check if supported

    3. TCs for single specific attribute
        Like in case of 2.

    4. All attribute TCs
        a. all common, all specific
        b. negative: try to create/update with non-existing attribute

    5. Test C/R/U/D with all valid RCN values with resource with all common and all specific attributes set
