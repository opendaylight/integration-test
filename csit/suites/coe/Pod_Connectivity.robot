Verify L2 Connectivity Between Pods
    [Documentation]    This testcase verifies the connectivity between pods brought up on the same node.Pods are brought on the same node by using the same node selector in busybox.yaml files.

Verify L3 Connectivity Between Pods
    [Documentation]    This testcase verifies the connectivity between pods brought up on different nodes.Nodes are given different labels(eg : ssd,ssl) through Coe.Label Nodes keyword.
    ...    These labels are also inlcuded as node selectors in busybox.yaml files ,thus the pods are placed on the desired nodes avoiding random allocation of pods.
    ...    For the pod to be eligible to run on a node, the node must have each of the indicated key-value pairs as labels.
    Create Pods    ssd    ${BUSY_BOXES[2]}    ${BB_NAMES[2]}
    Create Pods    ssl    ${BUSY_BOXES[3]}    ${BB_NAMES[3]}
