Documentation     Test suite to verify fitration operation on different models.
...               Before test starts, configurational file have to be rewriten to change listners registration datastore type from CONFIGURATION to OPERATIONAL.
...               Need for this change is also a reason why main feature (odl-topoprocessing-framework) is installed after file change and not during boot.
...               Tests themselves install feature required for specific model, clear karaf logs for futher synchronization, send configurational xmls and verify output.
...               Topology-id on the end of each urls must match topology-id from xml. Yang models of components in topology are defined in xmls.
