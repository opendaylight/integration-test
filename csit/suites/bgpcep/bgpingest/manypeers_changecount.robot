...
...               This suite uses play.py processes as iBGP peers.
...               This is analogue of single peer performance suite, which uses many peers.
...               Each peer is of ibgp type, and they contribute to the same example-bgp-rib,
...               and thus to the same single example-ipv4-topology.
...               The suite only looks at example-ipv4-topology, so RIB is not examined.
...
...               This suite requires odl-bgpcep-data-change-counter to be installed so
...               make sure it is added to "install-features" of any jobs that are going to invoke it.
...               Use the other version of the suite (manypeers_prefixcount.robot) if the feature does not work.
...
...               The suite consists of two halves, differing on which side initiates BGP connection.
...               Data change counter is a lightweight way to detect "work is being done".
...               WaitUtils provide a nice Keyword to wait for stability, but it needs
...               initial value, that is why Store_Change_Count appears just before work-inducing action.
...               The time for Wait_For_Stable_* cases to finish is the main performance metric.
...               After waiting for stability is done, full check on number of prefixes present is performed.
...
...               TODO: Currently, if a bug causes zero increase of data changes,
...               affected test cases will wait for max time. Reconsider.
...               If zero increase is allowed as stable, higher number of repetitions should be required.
...
...               ODL distinguishes peers by their IP addresses.
...               Currently, this suite requires python utils to be started on ODL System,
...               to guarantee IP address block is available for them to bind to.
...               TODO: Figure out how to use Docker and docker IP pool available in RelEng.
...
...               Currently, 127.0.0.1 is hardcoded as the first peer address to use.
...               TODO: Figure out how to make it configurable.
...               As peer IP adresses are set incrementally, we need ipaddr to be used in Robot somehow.
...
...               TODO: Is there a need for version of this suite where ODL connects to pers?
...               Note that configuring ODL is slow, which may affect measured performance singificantly.
...               Advanced TODO: Give manager ability to start pushing on trigger long after connections are established.
