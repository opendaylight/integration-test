...
...               This suite uses play.py as single iBGP peer.
...               The suite only looks at example-ipv4-topology, so RIB is not examined.
...
...               The suite consists of two halves, differing on which side initiates BGP connection.
...               State of "work is being done" is detected by increasing value of prefixes in topology.
...               The time for Wait_For_Stable_* cases to finish is the main performance metric.
...               After waiting for stability is done, full check on number of prefixes present is performed.
...
...               TODO: Currently, if a bug causes prefix count to remain at zero,
...               affected test cases will wait for max time. Reconsider.
...               If zero is allowed as stable, higher period or repetitions would be required.
...
...               The prefix counting is quite heavyweight and may induce large variation in time.
...               Try the other version of the suite (singlepeer_changecount.robot) to get better precision.
