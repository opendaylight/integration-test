*** Variables ***
${BUNDLE_PREFIX}    distribution-karaf    # BUNDLEFOLDER may contain -SNAPSHOT part, which is not present in the archive name.
${BUNDLE_SUFFIX}    .zip
${DISTRIBUTION_SIZE_LIMIT}    469762048    # == 7 * 64 MiB, Nexus limit is 8 * 64 MiB.

*** Test Cases ***
Distribution_Size
    [Documentation]    Run "ls" on ODL_SYSTEM, parse file size and compare to ${DISTRIBUTION_SIZE_LIMIT}.
    SSHKeywords.Open_Connection_To_ODL_System
    # TODO: 'du -b' is shorter, but gives less info. Is that better than ls?
    ${ls_output} =    SSHKeywords.Execute_Command_Should_Pass    command=bash -c 'ls -lAn ${WORKSPACE}/${BUNDLE_PREFIX}*${BUNDLE_SUFFIX}'
    ${size} =    SSHKeywords.Execute_Command_Should_Pass    command=echo '${ls_output}' | cut -d ' ' -f 5
    # The following probably fails of there were multiple *.zip files listed.
    BuiltIn.Should_Be_True    ${size} < ${DISTRIBUTION_SIZE_LIMIT}    Distribution size ${size} is not smaller than limit ${DISTRIBUTION_SIZE_LIMIT}.
