...
...               Features needed to be installed:
...               odl-distribution-version (the main feature, defines the version string holder as a config module)
...               odl-netconf-connector (controller-config device is used to access the config subsystem)
...               odl-restconf (or odl-restconf-noauth, to get restconf access to the data mounted by controller-config)
...
...               Variables needed to be rovided on pybot invocation:
...               ${BUNDLEFOLDER} (directory name of ODL installation, as it is suffxed by the distribution version)
...
...               This suite require both Restconf and Netconf-connector to be ready,
...               so it is recommended to run netconfready.robot before running this suite.
...
...               TODO: Figure out a way to reliably predict Odlparent version.
...               Possibly, inspection of system/org/opendaylight/odlparent/ would be required.

Distribution_Version
    [Documentation]    Get version string as a part of ${BUNDLEFOLDER} and match with what RESTCONF says.
    # ${BUNDLEFOLDER} typically looks like this: distribution-karaf-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT
    ${version} =    BuiltIn.Evaluate    '''${BUNDLEFOLDER}'''[len("distribution-karaf-"):]
