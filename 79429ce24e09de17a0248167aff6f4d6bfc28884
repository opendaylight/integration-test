      "message": "This script currently adds as many ports to \"bridge_name \u003d \u0027br-0-test\u0027\" as specified in instances. (See line 202)\n\nThis code that adds a delete function that deletes only one port from each bridge \"br-\u003cN\u003e-test\". So the add and delete functionality appears to be different.\n\nThe most useful delete behavior would be to undo what the script has done previously. While I\u0027m not opposed to adding N bridges with one port and then deleting N bridges with one port the former functionality is not present.",
