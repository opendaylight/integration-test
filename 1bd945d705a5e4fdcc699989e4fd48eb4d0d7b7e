      "message": "Reg: \"I think the IPv6 address configured on VM is retrieved from DHCP neutron.\" - I don\u0027t have the complete picture of how these robot tests are executed, but in the general use-case of Netvirt, the IPv6 address would be configured based on the RA from ipv6service.\n\nAgree with your point that we are validating GUA. The LLA is  auto-configured by the Operating System. My thoughts behind validating LLA is to verify that ELAN pipeline is supporting LLA connectivity as well. \nIts fine, its not a mandatory thing. So you can ignore my comment.",
