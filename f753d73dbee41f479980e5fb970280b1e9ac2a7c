If the first MPSS fails, WUKS will start another one 11 seconds in, and it will take another 9 seconds. So 20 seconds instead of 12. I do not like that.\nWhat is your minimum (in term of time taken) condition to consider MPSS passed? I do not really think 1 out of 10 pings is that minimum, considering you apply WUKS on top of that.",
