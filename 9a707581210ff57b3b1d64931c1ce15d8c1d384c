      "message": "I\u0027m out of ideas. I spent about an hour this morning trying to figure it out. I have no idea why this particular repo fails to clone the \u0027master\u0027 branch.\n\nIn any case this repo is just a wrapper for robotframework-tidy so there\u0027s not really much activity in this repo and we can still benefit from new releases from robot-tidy. I only anticipate this repo needing to be updated if there\u0027s a robot-tidy releasee that breaks the wrapper.\n\nLooking at the commit log for this wrapper in the past year there was only 1 commit contributed to support robot-tidy 3.2. So yeah very low activity here.",
