      "message": "Modifying the object you are iterating through is an undefined operation (especially when the object is a dictionary). [1] doesn\u0027t say that replacing values is unsafe but that is not the same as saying replacing values is safe (note that \"replacing a value\" is not the same as \"modifying a mutable value\"). [2] and [3] seem to suggest that replacing values in a dictionary while iterating it is safe now but we don\u0027t know whether it will stay safe in the future. Additionally, this code sets a bad example, encouraging others to tinker with the container they are iterating over and it will be only a matter of time when they fall into one of the dangerous pits. So it is better to be safe than sorry. Collect the key/value pairs with the new values into a list and put the new values into \"obj\" after the iteration is over.\n\n[1] https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict.iteritems\n[2] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6777485/modifying-a-python-dict-while-iterating-over-it\n[3] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2315520/in-python-how-do-i-loop-through-the-dictionary-and-change-the-value-if-it-equal",
