      "message": "We need some delay between pass -\u003e drop, in this case when we create pass action immediatley we creating drop action then start pining, so some packets are sending betwenn hosts but it should not happen for drop action, so we have to add some delay, as jamo suggest no need to add sleep, we came with the method split ping, for first cycle(result1) is as delay then we are checking (result2) and getting the result",

      "message": "\u003e We need some delay\n\nSleeps are bad because Wait Until Keyword Succeeds constructs (WUKS) are better. But obfuscated code equivalent to sleep is worse than plain sleep.\n\nSo I would recommend to rework current 2 keywords Mininet Ping Should Succeed and Mininet Ping Should Not Succeed to use as small -c value as you need (1 if there are no packet drops expected, 2 they are possible but rare).\nThen introduce and use keywords named something like Wait Until Mininet Ping Stops Succeeding and Wait Until Mininet Ping Starts Succeeding (or write corresponding WUKS directly to suite code). This way person reading the suite code would have a better idea about behavior to expect.",
