This way we all know that this function\u0027s purpose is to fail if the condition is not satisfied, the same way the other \"should\" functions do.",

      "message": "Good idea to have consistent naming scheme, but not sure about Should.\nLooking at BuiltIn keyword names [0], I think the main idea is that keyword starts with a verb. There are 7 exceptions. 2 of them (Fatal_Error, No_Operation) do not contain a verb, and Regexp_Escape has it in wrong position.\nOther 4 (Variable_Should_Exist, Variable_Should_Not_Exist, Keyword_Should_Exist and Length_Should_Be) are written like that just because of English grammar, for example Should_Name_Existing_Variable is less readable.\n\nBut in all those cases, the Should refer to a property of a given argument. So I would expect Tunnel_Status_Should_Be_Unknown to take ${output} argument.\n\nI have put my thoughts to the guidelines [1]. According to that, I would name this Check_Tunnel_Status_Is_Unknown.\n\n[0] http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Shortcuts\n[1] https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Integration/Test/Test_Code_Guidelines#Naming_scheme",
