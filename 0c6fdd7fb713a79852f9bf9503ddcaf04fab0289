      "message": "Two main reasons we are doing it one by one, at least for now:\na. It looks much much better in the report, we get a separate robot test case for each test and a convenient log per test to debug in case of failures, see [1].\nb. There are a lot of tempest tests, we aren\u0027t currently aware of all of them, what they do and how long they take to run. These ones I added initially are good candidates of stable tests that check networking and don\u0027t run too long. We can add more/refactor later, but as long as this is in our daily csit/gate I prefer stability over maximum coverage/tests, and to use a whitelist instead of a blacklist (unlike API tests which there are a ton of and are all pretty straightforward).\n\n[1] https://logs.opendaylight.org/sandbox/jenkins091/netvirt-csit-1node-openstack-mitaka-upstream-transparent-boron/16/archives/log.html.gz#s1-s2-s1",
