Maybe because {resource}.{keyword} works, but {resource}.{variable} does not.\n\nOr maybe because Resources with variables usually only list one variable Resource, which evokes inheriting from parent; whereas Resources with Keywords usually list several keyword Resources, which evokes listing upstream dependencies, no clear parent and precision is required.",
