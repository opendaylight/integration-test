      "message": "I don\u0027t want the invocations of this keyword to have cryptic arguments as in \"Deploy_Artifact | bgpcep/pcep-pcc-mock | -pcep-pcc-mock.jar\", I prefer the simpler \"Deploy_Artifact | bgpcep/pcep-pcc-mock | pcep-pcc-mock\" (and, to be honest, I even think about simplifying it to \"Deploy_Artifact | bgpcep/pcep-pcc-mock\", making the \"$(type_suffix)\" default to the part of the value \"${artifact}\" from the last \"/\" to its end. The complexity in the code is to account for tools that break the convention of having their jars in the form some/directory/somewhere/${name-of-the-tool}-${version-tag}-${name-of-the-tool}.jar where the \"some/directory/somewhere/\" and \"${name-of-the-tool}\" are supplied as arguments to this keyword and \"${version-tag}\" is digged out of the maven metadata.\n\nRight now I am inclined towards removing the \"${type_suffix}\" completely and require that all test tools adhere to the naming convention. This way all the test tools could be deployed with a simple keyword invocation without any cryptic \"executable line noise\" around it.\n\nOr I might do better: Simplify this keyword according to your comment and create another called \"Deploy_Test_Tool\" which will take only the name of the test tool, calculate the \"${artifact}\" and \"${type_suffix}\" arguments according to the convention and then call \"Deploy_Artifact\" with these arguments. This way \"Deploy_Artifact\" does not have to deal with various conventions of the different types of artifacts, keeping it nicely simple and readable and I still get my \"simple keyword invocation\" part of this work.",
