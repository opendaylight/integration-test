      "message": "grep ${EMPTY} will return an error so this isn\u0027t good as is. Looks like the only user of this keyword is the l3bcast suite and that always has a submeta so maybe we should remove the \u003d${EMPTY} so other users don\u0027t mistakenly think they can pass nothing. Other option is to check if submeta is empty and produce cmd based on that check - so one command with | grep and the other without.",
