From hard coded values it was moved to variables which a step forward.\nWhen adapting this to use USE_NETCONF_CONNECTOR as i did in refs/changes/66/48866/4 the result is \nhttps://logs.opendaylight.org/sandbox/jenkins091/netconf-csit-1node-periodic-scale-all-carbon/2/archives/log.html.gz#s1-s2 \nand the test Run_RestPerfClient_Through_Netconf_Connector will take 1 hour. I prefer to be merged as it is for better debugging as a next step.",
