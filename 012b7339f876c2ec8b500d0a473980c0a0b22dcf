Seems like the code to wait for the vm to launch shoudl cache the ip\u0027s at that time. Then these functions can stay as they are with the ip parameter.",

After the Verify VMs Received DHCP Lease is done, we can call the keyword to get all the IPs.\n\nthis way the other keywords don\u0027t have to figure it out every time, and we can keep them as is passing the VM IP as an argument instead of the vm name.\n\njust thinking out loud",
