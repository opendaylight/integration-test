Why is code for deleting termination points under ports, but adding term points is under term and ports?\n\nIf we wanted to put term \u0027add\u0027 and \u0027delete\u0027 under ports and take away logic for \u0027term\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t mind this, but I don\u0027t think we should have both partially used.",
