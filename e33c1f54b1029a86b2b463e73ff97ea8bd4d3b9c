      "message": "This would potentially hide Bug 8430. Currently I believe In this particular scenario, no information from the rejoining member should cause 501, and if that happens it means UnreachableMember happened just after rejoin (which is the Bug).\n\nAlso, the actual pattern I have seen on Sandbox is first check passes, then a few fail and finally it stabilizes on passing. This particular WUKS would pass in the first check, letting the line 61 fail.\n\nYou may move the WUKS addition to child Change so it is ready if something changes, but for now I would like to merge most of this, just without the additional WUKS.",
