      "message": "The logging piece we could merge. I will push another patch for that to keep it isolated. The change to the l2.robot to add the csit shouldn\u0027t go in either as the connectivity suite does that, but I guess we could modify the clustering suite to check for the csit sg and create if needed. I can push a patch for that since suites should be able to run alone.",
