      "message": "here we should check the status of should match regexp, if fail, then add table to a list, then continue. So you need to ignore the failure but get the rc and then keep looping. Then after this loop check the size of list, if not 0 then fail. Might also want to do the same to the calling keyword so that we can also loop all three nodes. So have this keyword here return the list of failed tables. Then in the keyword above, it keeps going to the end and it checks if any of the lists are not 0 and fails.",

      "message": "That\u0027s half of what I am suggesting. The problem with just ignoring and continuing is that you will go through the whole list and never know which tables failed. Worse this test will never fail - even if there were failures since you ignored the failures and continued. So you need the rc, if fail add the table to the faillist and then keep going. The faillist keeps track of the tables that had a missing entry. After going through all the tables you then need to check the faillist to decide to fail the test or not.",
