      "message": "Yes, well this is done intentionally. This way we don\u0027t have to specify and check for every single element in output topos, only those that matter in a given test. Maybe I should rename the keyword to something like \"Output Topo Should Contain\"?\nAFAIK the CIO kw does not allow optional/ignorable keys (zero means item should not be present). A workaround of conditional adding of items to the dictionary would kinda defeat the purpose.",
