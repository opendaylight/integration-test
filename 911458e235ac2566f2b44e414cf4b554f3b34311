They may be specified by -v, but they should not change value during suite execution.\n\nSuite variables that change value dynamically and perhaps are undefined at the start of the suite, those should not be ALL_CAPS, I believe.\n\nOn the other hand, such suite variable should be there only to communicate state between test cases, which is not needed here.",
