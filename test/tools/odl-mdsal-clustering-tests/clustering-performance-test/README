OpenDaylight Performance Test Suite
===================================

The performance tests in this suite use ODL's RESTCONF API to add/delete
flows into/from ODL's configuration data store. The test suite is meant for
manual performance testing, where a user can tests different ways/scale to
add and delete flows.

The test suite contains the following scripts:

- inventory_crawler.py: 
  Retrieves all nodes from either the config or operational data store
  and prints a flow summary to the console. Depending on the print level
  specified in a command line option, the summary can shows the overall
  number of flows in the network, the number of flows in each node, or 
  detailed data for each flow

- flow_config_blaster.py:
  Adds and deletes ("blasts") flows into ODL's config space. Command line
  options control the number of "blaster" threads, the number of blast 
  cycles, the number of flows blasted in each cycle by each thread, etc. 
  flow_config_blaster.py provides the FlowConfigBlaster class that is 
  reusable in other tests, such as in flow_add_delete_test.py

- config_cleanup.py:
  Cleans up the config data store by deleting the entire inventory.

- flow_add_delete_test.py:
  Adds/deletes ("blasts") flows into ODL's config space. Similar to the 
  flow_config_blaster (in fact, flow_config_blaster is used in this test),
  but has more advanced handling of the add/delete cycles. The test 
  executes in three steps:
  1. The specified number of flows is added in the 'add cycle' (uses
     flow_config_blaster to blast flows)
  2. The network is polled for flow statistics from the network 
     (using the inventory_crawler) to make sure that all flows have been 
     properly programmed into the network and stats can properly read them
  3. The flows are deleted in the flow cycle (either in 'bulk' using the 
     config_cleanup script or one by one using the flow_config_blaster) 



The Inventory Crawler:
======================
To see the command line options, type:
> ./inventory_crawler --help

usage: inventory_crawler.py [-h] [--odlhost ODLHOST] [--odlport ODLPORT]
                            [--plevel PLEVEL]
                            [--datastore {operational,config}] [--no-auth]
                            [--auth] [--debug]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --odlhost ODLHOST     host where odl controller is running (default is
                        127.0.0.1)
  --odlport ODLPORT     port on which odl's RESTCONF is listening (default is
                        8181)
  --plevel PLEVEL       Print Level: 0 - Summary (stats only); 1 - Node names;
                        2 - Node details;3 - Flow details
  --datastore {operational,config}
                        Which data store to crawl; default operational
  --no-auth             Do not use authenticated access to REST (default)
  --auth                Use authenticated access to REST (username: 'admin',
                        password: 'admin').
  --debug               List nodes that have not provided proper statistics
                        data

Examples:
---------
To show a summary of all flows shown in the network, type:
> ./inventory_crawler.py --plevel=1 --auth

NOTE: REST authentication is turned by default in ODL Helium. To use 
authenticated REST, you have to specify the '--auth' switch in the command
line.

To show a summary of all flows shown in the config data store, type:
> ./inventory_crawler.py --plevel=1 --datastore=config --auth



The Flow Config Blaster:
========================
To see the command line options, type:
  > ./flow_config_blaster.py --help

usage: flow_config_blaster.py [-h] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                              [--cycles CYCLES] [--threads THREADS]
                              [--flows FLOWS] [--nodes NODES] [--delay DELAY]
                              [--delete] [--no-delete] [--auth]
                              [--startflow STARTFLOW] [--file FILE]

Flow programming performance test: First adds and then deletes flows into the
config tree, as specified by optional parameters.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           Host where odl controller is running (default is
                        127.0.0.1)
  --port PORT           Port on which odl's RESTCONF is listening (default is
                        8181)
  --cycles CYCLES       Number of flow add/delete cycles; default 1. Both Flow
                        Adds and Flow Deletes are performed in cycles.
                        <THREADS> worker threads are started in each cycle and
                        the cycle ends when all threads finish. Another cycle
                        is started when the previous cycle finished.
  --threads THREADS     Number of request worker threads to start in each
                        cycle; default=1. Each thread will add/delete <FLOWS>
                        flows.
  --flows FLOWS         Number of flows that will be added/deleted by each
                        worker thread in each cycle; default 10
  --nodes NODES         Number of nodes if mininet is not connected;
                        default=16. If mininet is connected, flows will be
                        evenly distributed (programmed) into connected nodes.
  --delay DELAY         Time (in seconds) to wait between the add and delete
                        cycles; default=0
  --delete              Delete all added flows one by one, benchmark delete
                        performance.
  --no-delete           Do not perform the delete cycle.
  --auth                Use the ODL default username/password 'admin'/'admin'
                        to authenticate access to REST; default: no
                        authentication
  --startflow STARTFLOW
                        The starting Flow ID; default=0
  --file FILE           File from which to read the JSON flow template;
                        default: no file, use a built in template.

NOTE: The 'startflow' command line parameter is used with multiple 
flow_config_blasters blasting flows at the same ODL instance. With Python's
GIL any given blaster can not use more than one CPU even when multiple blaster 
threads are specified. Therefore, multiple blaster processes must be used to
test ODL's performance limits. The 'startflow' parameter gives each blaster 
process its own flow id space so that each injects unique flows into ODL's
config data store.

NOTE: You don't have to be connected to mininet (or another openflow network,
for that matter) to use this script. If ODL is connected to an openflow 
network, flow_config_blaster will evenly distribute flows across the network.
If ODL is not connected to a network, flows are only stored in the config 
data store (i.e. nodes that may connect at some point in the future are in 
effect "preconfigured"). The not-connected mode can be used to test the 
performance of the data store and the REST subsystems. The 'nodes' parameter
determines how many nodes are used in the non-connected mode.

Examples:
---------
To put 5000 flows into ODL running on the same node as the script type:
   > ./flow_config_blaster.py --flows=5000 --auth --no-delete

To use 5 threads to put 5000 flows into ODL running on the same node as 
the script type:
   > ./flow_config_blaster.py --threads=5 --flows=1000 --auth --no-delete

   NOTE: each thread will put 1000 flows, and all 5 threads will work 
   simultaneously.

To first put and then delete 5000 flows into ODL running on the same node
as the script type:
   > ./flow_config_blaster.py --flows=5000 --auth

To use 5 threads to first put and then delete 5000 flows into ODL running 
on the same node as the script type:
   > ./flow_config_blaster.py --threads=5 --flows=1000 --auth
  
 NOTE: 5 threads are used to both add and delete flows

To use 5 threads to first put and then delete 5000 flows into ODL in 10 
add/delete cycles type:
   > ./flow_config_blaster.py --threads=5 --flows=100 --cycles=10 --auth

   NOTE: 5 threads are used to both add and delete flows. 

   NOTE: Both Add and Delete are performed in 10 cycles. 5 worker threads 
   are started in each cycle and the cycle ends when all threads finish. 
   Cycles are useful to determine performance degradation with increasing
   number of flows in the datastore and in the network.

To  put and then delete 1000 flows with nicira match and action extensions,
type:
   >./flow_config_blaster.py --flows=1000 --auth --file=./nicira-ext-all.json

   NOTE: json for flow adds will be taken from the file 'nicira-ext-all.json'
