Documentation     ODL controller clustering test case using the gherkin syntax.
...
...               This test has a workflow similar to the keyword-driven
...               examples. The difference is that the keywords use higher
...               abstraction level and their arguments are embedded into
...               the keyword names.
...
...               This kind of _gherkin_ syntax has been made popular by
...               [http://cukes.info|Cucumber]. It works well especially when
...               tests act as examples that need to be easily understood also
...               by the business people.

*** Test Cases ***
Controller1 and Controller2 fail
    Given C1 a controller in cluster of two controllers
    And C2 a controllers in cluster of two controllers
    And all switches are introduced to both controllers
    When C1 goes down
    And C2 goes down
    Then the system does not work any more


*** Keywords ***
