      "message": "Unfortunately I didn\u0027t save the results. I can try to rerun it, but currently hitting some other issues...\n\nThe problem here is logic of the condition. It works only for dhcp_length 0 and 1. \n\nVMs in my deployment get multiple nameservers, so dhcp_length \u003d\u003d 3. This particular \"Should be true\" then fails, because \u00273\u0027 is not \u003c\u003d \u00271\u0027. And doesn\u0027t return, so I don\u0027t get ip_list, nor dhcp_ip (which is also a list). A better condition would be ${dhcp_length} \u003e\u003d 1. I tried this and the robot documentation regarding builtins is wrong ($rc \u003c 10 means rc is lower, not greater than, as \"natural\"). But the following line would never be true.\n\nI believe, that dhcp_length shouldn\u0027t make this function fail, especially since it returns ip_list and EMPTY if it\u0027s \u003d\u003d 0, and ip_list and dhcp_ip otherwise...",

      "message": "In your setup is it because there are multiple dhcp agents for HA? That would explain the extra nameservers. The upstream does not use more than one agent so we expect a single address.\n\nEven if there are more than one, is it OK if only one is returned? All the tests currently expect a single address. It may work returning more but we need to verify that.\n\nThat being said, let\u0027s hold off on this change. WE are migrating everything to use the newer GET VM IPs. That keyword doesn\u0027t have the problem, but it does forcefully only return a single dhcp address.",
