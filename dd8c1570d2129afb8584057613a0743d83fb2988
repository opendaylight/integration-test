      "message": "Unfortunately I didn\u0027t save the results. I can try to rerun it, but currently hitting some other issues...\n\nThe problem here is logic of the condition. It works only for dhcp_length 0 and 1. \n\nVMs in my deployment get multiple nameservers, so dhcp_length \u003d\u003d 3. This particular \"Should be true\" then fails, because \u00273\u0027 is not \u003c\u003d \u00271\u0027. And doesn\u0027t return, so I don\u0027t get ip_list, nor dhcp_ip (which is also a list). A better condition would be ${dhcp_length} \u003e\u003d 1. I tried this and the robot documentation regarding builtins is wrong ($rc \u003c 10 means rc is lower, not greater than, as \"natural\"). But the following line would never be true.\n\nI believe, that dhcp_length shouldn\u0027t make this function fail, especially since it returns ip_list and EMPTY if it\u0027s \u003d\u003d 0, and ip_list and dhcp_ip otherwise...",
