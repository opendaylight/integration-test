      "message": "This is too much of code duplication if we compare with previous KW. I would suggest to create new KW called Get_Raft_Property_From_Shard_Member and you pass the property (Raft State, Current Term, Last Index, etc...) as argument. After that you can easily create KWs like Get_Raft_State_Of_Shard_At_Member, Get_Current_Term_Of_Shard_At_Member, etc.. by reusing the new KW.",
