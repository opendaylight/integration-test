      "message": "This script and the push_data script are very short. No point splitting them into 2 files.\n\nMy original intent for my suggestion was even more basic when I was requesting that the scripts be split into 2 because I was expecting you to make a generally reusable macro that pushes data to Elastic Search.\n\nI thought that the scripts in CSIT would generate the JSON body and then the JJB macro would take that JSON body and push it to ES.",
