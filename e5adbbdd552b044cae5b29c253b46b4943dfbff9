      "message": "Good question.  \n\nIdeally i would like to cleanup the routes here itself irrespective of this test failure, because the subsequent tests \u0027think\u0027 that the extra-route doesn\u0027t exist :)\n\nHowever, here Should Contain success only triggers the execution of the two steps.\n\nA router moved into an L3VPN will result in the L3VPN embracing all the elements connected to a router, including extra-routes.  So retaining the extra-route in the subsequent test-cases boosts the test coverage for extra-route on L3VPN trigger.\n\nAnd I clear the extra-route down below, because Openstack (not ODL) does not allow router interfaces to be removed if an extra-route is configured in the router using that router-interface.",

      "message": "ok, so we can force robot to run these steps even if there is a failure in the test case.  add this as the last line here:\n\n    [Teardown]    Run Keywords    Update Router    @{ROUTERS}[0]    ${RT_CLEAR}\n    ...    AND    Show Router    @{ROUTERS}[0]    -D\n\n\nI suggest we do that no matter what, in case someone comes in here and adds a \ntest case in the middle somewhere and wants to assume a clean env.\n\nnext, if you think we have better test coverage with some extra routes for L3VPN to\nembrace, let\u0027s add some extra routes (purposely) in that relevant test case.\n\nthanks for the patch, Vivek. I can also do these things if you are stuck. just let\nme know, but for now you can work via this patch.",
