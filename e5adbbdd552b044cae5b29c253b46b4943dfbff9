      "message": "Good question.  \n\nIdeally i would like to cleanup the routes here itself irrespective of this test failure, because the subsequent tests \u0027think\u0027 that the extra-route doesn\u0027t exist :)\n\nHowever, here Should Contain success only triggers the execution of the two steps.\n\nA router moved into an L3VPN will result in the L3VPN embracing all the elements connected to a router, including extra-routes.  So retaining the extra-route in the subsequent test-cases boosts the test coverage for extra-route on L3VPN trigger.\n\nAnd I clear the extra-route down below, because Openstack (not ODL) does not allow router interfaces to be removed if an extra-route is configured in the router using that router-interface.",
