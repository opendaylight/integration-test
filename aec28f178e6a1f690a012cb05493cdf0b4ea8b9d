That way port collision will be automatically visible.\nBut the current Port wiki has also nice property of including descriptions. Also we may want to distinguish primary features (which contain bundles performing the bind) and indirect features (which have primary feature in their dependency tree).\n\nI think it should be possible to have a table satisfying all of the previous paragraph, but it may need some parsing in the Robot code.",
