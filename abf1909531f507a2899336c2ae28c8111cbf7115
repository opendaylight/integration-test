The second problem with \"Issue Command On Karaf Console\" is that it open and closes a SSH connection each time it is used (huge time hog) and I don\u0027t want that in performance tests. Refactoring the stuff to play nice with performance testing would take several weeks of work if done properly and I also would be unable to make sure I did not break anything which translates to a need for a lengthy review from the community. Take a peek at this change: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/26734.

This leads me to conclusion that performance bugs in ODL could cause significant delays here. Thus the large timeout here.\n\nI suspect the problem here is a performance bug in ODL. You know, the ODL must find the routes from the dead peer and remove them while keeping other routes intact. It occurs to me that it is traversing the whole RIB+Topology, hunting them down. I can easily imagine a situation when there are several peers with 500k-1M routes and then one 10k routed one disconnects. It might take a long while for ODL wading through the routes from the 500k+ route servers before it finds some of the 10k routes from the disconnected peer.",

The remaining 60 seconds is a \"safety margin\". That explains the 180s in the \"..._To_Become_Empty\" line. The other 180s is due to a performance bug in ODL where it may take so much time for it to start cleaning up when there is a large amount of routes in RIB/Topology. And I already designed these keywords to bail out of the loop early if the change counter spits out an error message instead of a result but it is not easy to see that. Namely, Robot does not have support for keywords which tri-state results (PASS, FAIL_NOT_BUT_MAY_PASS_LATER and FAIL_WITH_NO_HOPE_TO_PASS) so a bunch of tricks must be employed to make it work. See \"Check_Topology_Stability\" keyword and note that it is designed to PASS when the response code returned from the request is an error - this is exactly the tricky part used to bail out of the Wait_Until_Keyword_Succeeds keyword.",
