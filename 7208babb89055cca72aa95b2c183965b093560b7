      "message": "just get rid of the directory and call the script explicitly. Also remove the number prepended to the scripts. That\u0027s what we did with the netvirt/openstack tests. Makes it easier to follow since you know what scripts will be in in testplan without having to worry about organizing them into directories.\n\nThis should remove a lot of the edited path\u0027s so you can focus on just the new tdd stuff.\n\nthis also means you don\u0027t have to move the scripts from the tdd dir to the main dir when they are ready - you simply edit the test plans. though that is similar to moving the script, but modifying test plans is more intuitive.",

      "message": "Yes! This solves other problem I was thinking about, how to add the WiP suite to main once it is ready. Just moving in testplan.txt should take care of it. My only issue is how will __init__ fit the picture? Lets say all are set up in suites/genius/ if I give suite1.robot, it won\u0027t invoke __init__ while I think currently it does. I think am just not sure of how __init__ works and if need to get rid of it to do what you proposed.",

      "message": "Personally, I don\u0027t use the __init__ for this reason - I can never remember when it is called or not and I always forget about the file. I would move the __init__ stuff into a genius.robot file and make it explicit that the stuff is called in suite setup.\n\nI think what is happening now, is that stuff in init is called for each suite as part of start suite.",
