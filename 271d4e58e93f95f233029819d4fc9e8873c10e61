      "message": "This would be out-of-scope for this patch I guess, but the way you\u0027re using num_instances is a bit strange imho. Helper fns that add/del ports/bridges/etc use this global value for how many of things they should add/del. A more clear way would be to pass num_ports, num_bridges, etc to the helpers directly, not maintain it as an instance var.",
