      "message": "when I was looking at the additions above in this file, I was having a hard time understanding what is going on, so\nI looked here. This is sort of a clunky keyword and\nhas nothing to do with \"acl\" stuff and probably should\nhave been something coming from our ovs lib.\n\nI didn\u0027t look at what we already have in a common lib,\nbut a keyword like:\n\nVerify OVS Flow Table Should Contain\n    [Arguments]    ${conn_id}    ${bridge}    ${table_id}    ${elements}\n\n    SSHLibrary.Switch Connection    ${conn_id}\n\n    ${output} \u003d    Write Commands Until Expected Prompt    sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows ${bridge} -OOpenFlow13 | grep table\u003d${table_id}    ${DEFAULT_LINUX_PROMPT_STRICT}\n\n    Should Contain    ${output}    table\u003d${table_id}\n    : FOR    ${element}    IN    @{elements}\n    \\    Should Contain    ${output}    ${element}\n\n\n\nThat allows you to pass in any number of strings to check for in the output\nof all flows in that given table.\n\njust an idea for a future refactor. Actually, this might already be\navailable in a common lib.",
