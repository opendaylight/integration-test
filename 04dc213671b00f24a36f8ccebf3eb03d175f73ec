      "message": "Some of the keywords can be altered and reused for test cases in OFT that involve single Vteps creation and deletion without failing logic for other test cases. In single vteps, initially, even though NUM_TOOLS_SYSTEMS maybe 3, but only 2 are processed.\n\nHere, the size of @{tools_ips} is always 3. Why? I am using sparse lists. The tools system that is unused will be left as ${EMPTY} value in the list and will be excluded from processing as required by single vteps. How is that a reason for not using TOOLS_SYSTEM_ALL_IPS or why is there a need for sparse lists? Certain test cases (from Configure ITM suite) pass IPv6 address list as argument to this keyword. That list is not the same as TOOLS_SYSTEM_ALL_IPS which is IPv4 only and also that is not cached by Genius library. Instead it uses the tools_system_index to map the IP to its correct DPN in Set Json keyword. In order to avoid disrupting that logic, I have used sparse lists. It maintains the indices for the tools systems. Hopefully that\u0027ll explain changes in some other keywords as well.",
