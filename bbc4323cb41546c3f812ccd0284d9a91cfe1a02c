So, I changed this\nVerify_Members_Are_Ready kw to account for that.\n\nthis patch:\nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/79385/3/csit/libraries/ClusterManagement.robot\n\nif your code works though, it\u0027s fine. it shouldn\u0027t\nmatter. I just wanted to check. But, if you wanted to\nnot give any argument here for service_list, it will\nwork like you want as well.\n\nI\u0027m ready to merge this, just wanted to double check.",
