      "message": "Regarding the second half of the comment from patch set 2, line 370, I also like the idea to require the data change counter to be stable for several tests in a row before we proclaim it to be stable. However implementing that idea is quite involved work so I would like to have it in a separate change which is reviewed independently. Namely I prefer to have \"less perfect\" test now and make it \"perfect\" later than to have no test until \"later\". Additionally I feel this \"separate change\" to be of a lesser priority.",
