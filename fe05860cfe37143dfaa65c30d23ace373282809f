      "message": "is the problem you are still seeing ${EMPTY} in the list? If so, then there must be a bug in the OS_ALL_IPS. That keyword is wrong right now since it is writing OS_COMPUTE_1_IP into the list. Maybe that is where the extra empty is coming from. So maybe just fix that there in DevstackUtils in the control+compute path.",
