Some suite use pypy. Install it.
Also install some packages pypy should recognice, mostly "requests".
Suites use SSH, scripts tell them to connect to 127.0.0.1
Overall check: make sure this works (aside asking for password):
ssh localhost 'pypy -c "import requests"'

Be sure that your JAVA_HOME points to Java 8 installation
and PATH is prioritized to search its bin. Checks:
ssh localhost 'java -version'
ssh localhost '${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -version'
