      "message": "correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but I think the keyword \"Verify VMs Received DHCP Lease\" is not ever going to fail. it\u0027s just \ngoing to return a list of IPs where some of IPs might be\nNone, or even ${EMPTY}\n\nwhat that means is this WUKS doesn\u0027t work. the first\niteration would pass so no looping.\n\nassuming that is right, I think moving the WUKS up to the\nsuite level would work. That WUKS would wrap this \"Verify\nAnd Collect VM DHCP Addresses\" which does have a failure\ncondition (if None is in the list). That lets each suite\ncontrol the polling loop as well. It could be that at some\npoint, some suite needs to wait a lot longer or even knows\nit can poll much quicker.",
